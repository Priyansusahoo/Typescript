### - first we have to create a file with .ts extention i.e typescript.

### - Secondly, we have to compile the .ts using the "tsc" command.

### - Then, after we compile the file we will get a .js file and then we can run the .js file using the "node" command.

### - NEVER edit ".js" files because it is generated my the TSC. Only Edit ".ts" file.
